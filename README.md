# System Daemon files

Here is a collection of useful system daemon files for things I run on various different servers. Please feel free to submit PRs to add service files for random things that worked for you :)

Currently containing service files for:

- Caddy v2 web server
- C-Lightning (fetching block headers using @fiatjaf's trustedcoin instead of btc full node)
